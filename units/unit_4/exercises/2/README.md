# Unit 4 - Exercise Two (Assigned) | Speed Limit Point Violation

## Objective

**New York State driving violations and associated points** (Use any means of conditional statements)

Build an app that allows a user to insert a posted speed limit and how fast they were driving at the time they received the violation.

The APP should output in return:

- How fast they were driving over the speed limit.
- How many points will be added to their license for the violation.

| **Violation**                                 | **Points** |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Speeding - MPH over speed limit not indicated | 3          |
| Speeding 1 - 10 MPH over speed limit          | 3          |
| Speeding 11 - 20 MPH over speed limit         | 4          |
| Speeding 21 - 30 MPH over speed limit         | 6          |
| Speeding 31 - 40 MPH over speed limit         | 8          |
| Speeding more than 40 MPH over speed limit    | 11         |

### Solution/Features

- Use of _const_ variables with capitalized naming
- Created helper functions for creating option nodes that append to select elements
- Use of self invoking functions that use an array and for loops to generate select HTML elements
- Use of _querySelector_ to choose, find and use the select HTML tags
- Creation of success and failure methods that output an error or success message based on proper inputs
- Use of functions and conditionals (if/else/switch) to verify blank inputs and that levels match proper section numbers
- Use of event listener with button
