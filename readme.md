# NYPL TechConnect | Project Code Phase II (JavaScript)

## The Program

A program sponsored by the New York Public Library that teaches JavaScript for the course of 6 weeks.

## Involvement

As a graduate of phase I and a self-starter who's been learning PHP, React, Node JS, SQL and more this is a chance for me to solidfy my JS skills. As part of the course we are given exercises to assist with building our JS knowledge. Below you will find links to the exercises assigned and my solutions.
